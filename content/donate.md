# Donate

Transportr is a non-profit Free Software project
and has never received a lot of donations.
If you still want to show your appreciation or
make a financial contribution, there are some ways to do it:

## Liberapay

Liberapay is a recurrent donations platform.

They help to fund the creators and projects you appreciate.
